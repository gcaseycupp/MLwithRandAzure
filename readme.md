## Machine Learning with R and Azure

#### **How many crimes will be committed in Denver tomorrow**

This is a sample project I did completed on predicting crime in Denver. I used SqlServer tables and views to manipulate the data.
I then use the Azure Machine Learning Studio to run the algorithms. I tested multiple and found Boosted Decision Tree Regression had the best results. The results were not as robust as I hoped, but the process was productive.

Included in this repo is a subset of the data used. I did not include all data, as part of the data was propieratry for a project I did for a company doing Machine Learning in the Retail space.

The primary document is the Power Point I used when I gave this talk at two meetups. ESRI GeoDev and Denver Maptime
